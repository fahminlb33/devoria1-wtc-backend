This is my submission for DEVORIA WTC.

In this repository you'll find my preferred codebase style which are highly influenced by my other project, [TASI](https://github.com/fahminlb33/tasi-backend). This project structure is also used in one of my squad service (LGC-Visibility). I hope I can demonstrate a clear and concise clean architecture in functional way (I'm more of an OOP guy).

More explanation will come later on after I finish testing this project.
